# Dog Trainer Program
This little project came about when my dogs got smarter than me. They knew I didn't like them getting up on the couch so they would simply wait until I left for work before jumping up and making themselves comfy.

## How it works
I designed this program to correct them even when I wasn't home. It's pretty simple but requires a computer with a webcam. A user (me) can select an area of the video feed to watch. Once that area gets triggered, various sound clips start playing. The sound clips are recording of me and my wife telling the dogs to get off the couch. They play at random to keep the dogs on their toes. Once the area is clear, the sounds stop. I receive email with a photo of the area when it triggers as well as a photo a few minutes after the trigger to verify that the program was successful.

I should say that this project was quite successful :)

The code is far from pretty (and 1 big file - gross) however it served it's purpose successfully. Last time I used it was a couple of years ago so it's possible the dependencies have changed.
